# Quizz app!

This was a fun exercise I did together with Alura 1 week online imersion into Next.js
and React Styled components to create a SPA. In the future, all quizzes with the tags
[alura](https://github.com/topics/alura),
[imersao-react](https://github.com/topics/imersao-react) and
[aluraquiz](https://github.com/topics/aluraquiz) will be merged into one large pool of
quizzes.
