# Quizz app!

This was a fun exercise done in collaboration with Alura: 1 week online imersion into Next.js
and React Styled components to create a SPA. Look for tags
[alura](https://github.com/topics/alura),
[imersao-react](https://github.com/topics/imersao-react) and
[aluraquiz](https://github.com/topics/aluraquiz) to look into other projects.

All these quizzes are build from a near-defined database, so in this app you will see links to other quizes, that can load in this same domain, only consuming their APIs to gather questions, answers and theme colors. To hit my API, access https://dnd-quiz.andrei-ce.vercel.app/api/db with a simple GET request.
